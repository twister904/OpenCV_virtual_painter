# Color Detection and Tracking using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to detect and track specific colors in a live video feed from your computer's camera.

## Feature Highlights

- Real-time color detection and tracking.
- Supports multiple colors (currently green and blue).
- Draws colored circles around detected color objects.
- Provides the center point of detected color objects.

## Usage Examples

1. **Running the Application**

   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - git clone https://github.com/twister904/OpenCV_virtual_painter.git

2. **Install OpenCV**

Make sure you have OpenCV installed and properly configured in your C++ development environment. Refer to the [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/) for installation instructions.

3. **Compile and Run**

- Navigate to the project directory.

- Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler. Ensure that you link the OpenCV libraries correctly.

- Run the compiled binary.


Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible by the application for live video feed. Adjust color ranges and parameters in the code as needed for your specific color detection requirements.
